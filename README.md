Project: This project is a collaborative work in progress for the University of Southern Maine for controlling 
microbots via a serial interface. The firmware is provided but may be subject ot updates which would 
accomodate a more modern interface. The interface and kinematics are implemented by the team members listed above.

Primary goals: robust solution to interface, automation, forward and inverse kinematics. 

Secondary goals: encorporating machine vision or adapting firmware to other platforms.
